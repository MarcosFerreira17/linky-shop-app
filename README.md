# code-store - this project are under development

See the overall picture of **implementations on microservices with .net tools** on real-world **e-commerce microservices** project;

![microservices_remastered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1147445/110304529-c5b70180-800c-11eb-832b-a2751b5bda76.png)

There is a couple of microservices which implemented **e-commerce** modules over **Catalog, Basket, Discount** and **Ordering** microservices with **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)** and **Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server)** with communicating over **RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication** and using **Ocelot API Gateway**.

### Check Explanation of this Repository on Medium
* [Microservices Architecture on .NET with applying CQRS, Clean Architecture and Event-Driven Communication](https://medium.com/aspnetrun/microservices-architecture-on-net-3b4865eea03f)
* [Microservices Observability, Resilience, Monitoring on .Net](https://medium.com/aspnetrun/microservices-observability-resilience-monitoring-on-net-a5dfbdbb0fbd)

## Whats Including In This Repository
We have implemented below **features over the run-aspnetcore-microservices repository**.

#### Catalog microservice which includes; 
* ASP.NET Core Web API application 
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* **MongoDB database** connection and containerization
* Repository Pattern Implementation
* Swagger Open API implementation	

#### Basket microservice which includes;
* ASP.NET Web API application
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* **Redis database** connection and containerization
* Consume Discount **Grpc Service** for inter-service sync communication to calculate product final price
* Publish BasketCheckout Queue with using **MassTransit and RabbitMQ**
  

#### Microservices Resilience Implementations
* Making Microservices more **resilient Use IHttpClientFactory** to implement resilient HTTP requests
* Implement **Retry and Circuit Breaker patterns** with exponential backoff with IHttpClientFactory and **Polly policies**

## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

* [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 
* [.Net Core 5 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```

>Note: If you get connection timeout error Docker for Mac please [Turn Off Docker's "Experimental Features".](https://github.com/aspnetrun/run-aspnetcore-microservices/issues/33)

4. Wait for docker compose all microservices. Thatâ€™s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

5. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:

* **Catalog API -> http://localhost:8000/swagger/index.html**
* **Basket API -> http://localhost:8001/swagger/index.html**
